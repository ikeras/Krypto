# Krypto

In 4th or 5th grade my teacher introduced the class to a card game called [Krypto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypto_(game)). It was a fun way to learn mental math and simple arithmetic. I was thinking about it the other day and decided it would make a great project to reintroduce myself to Python. 

The brief description:

This a math game where the goal is to create an expression using 5 provided numbers
that evaluates to the goal number. For example, if the goal number is 13 and the
provided numbers are 2, 6, 4, 5, and 6 then a correct answer would be: 2 + 6 - 5 + 4 + 6.
The only operators that may be used are +, -, *, /. Order of operations apply but can be
overridden using parantheses. Good luck and have fun!
